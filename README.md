# I - The prompt we used for our project
  We were going for a project linked to minecraft, and partucularly the mod create in which we would organize a production chain, with different factories, workers 
  and train stations to link them all. \
  You work in the field of Minecraft server administration and in-game industrial automation using the Create mod. Your Minecraft server faction is involved in the domain of in-game logistics, energy management, automated production, and railway networks routing. \ It is a Minecraft server faction such as FICSIT Inc. (from the game Satisfactory) or a major player-run corporation in EVE Online. Data about energy sources (e.g., water wheels, steam engines), production sites, automated factories, train stations and track links, player-run companies, server members acting as workers, and resources required or produced (e.g., andesite alloy, crushed ores, rotational force) has been collected. Take inspiration from the following  website : the official Minecraft Create Mod Wiki.\
Your Minecraft server faction wants to apply MERISE to design an information system. You are responsible for the analysis part, i.e., gathering the company's requirements. It has called on a computer engineering student to carry out this project, and you must provide him with the necessary information so that he can then apply the following steps of database design and development himself.
First, establish the data business rules for your Minecraft server faction in the form of a bulleted list. It must correspond to the information provided by someone who knows how the company works, but not how an information system is built.
Next, based on these rules, provide a raw data dictionary with the following columns, grouped in a table: meaning of the data, type, size in number of characters or digits. There should be between 25 and 35 data items. It is used to provide additional information about each data item (size and type) but without any assumptions about how the data will be modeled later.
Provide the business rules and the data dictionary.
